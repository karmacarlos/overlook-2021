## Wins and Challenges

**Wins**

- Solidified understanding and application of asynchronous JS
- Proficient management of accessibility standards achieving a score of 100 by lighthouse report
- Proficient use of iterator methods combining 3 data sets to return an user request keeping a performance above 95 by lighthouse report
- Demonstrated solid understanding of OOP by having 4 classes interacting with each other containing all the necessary logic inside.
- Solid implementation of TDD by writing all test and the implementation later, making sure the functionality of each class performed as planned.
- Proficient use of Github projects feature including issues to plan an execute project within 1 week
- Use of SCSS files to style the application while keeping DRY code

**Challenges**

- On the planning stage it was a challenge to try to anticipate all the different behaviors an properties that my classes needed to fullfil SRP and OOP standards.
- During the implementation it was a challenge to anticipate sad paths for the test suites.

## Future Additions

- Add a manager feature.
- Make the app responsive to different screen sizes.
- Improve styling by adding micro-modals, icons and more details to the elements.
